# UI-UX-Design

The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that allows University of Florida students to quickly claim their football tickets in the form of a QR code from anywhere. This eliminates students from needing a physical ticket and could decrease the need of bags brought to the stadium. This project must adhere to all the rules and regulations of app development, and it will be primarily used for all UF students.
