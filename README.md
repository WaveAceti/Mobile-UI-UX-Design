# Mobile-UI-UX-Design

The purpose of this project was to develop a mobile application that allowed University of Florida students to quickly claim their football tickets in the form of a QR code from anywhere. This eliminated students from needing a physical ticket and could decrease the need of bags brought to the stadium.
